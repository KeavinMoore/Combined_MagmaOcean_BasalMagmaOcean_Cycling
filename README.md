# Combined_MagmaOcean_Cycling


NOTE: The model presented here, and within Moore, Cowan, and Boukar√© (2023, MNRAS), has been updated. Users interested in using the combined magma ocean + deep-water cycling + water loss to space model should instead download the version in the repository "waterevolution_superearths", which includes a README file. This newer version of the model, presented within Moore et al. (2024, ApJ), has been made more user-friendly through the help of two undergraduate students during their senior thesis project.

Model combining early MO phase with longer cycling phase.
